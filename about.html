    </header>
    <p>Hello.  I am Austin Whitis.  I am a Games and 
        Interactive Media Bachelors major at MSU.  
        I like to make and play games.  I mainly focus 
        on game development and game design, though, 
        as drawing and such isn't my thing.

        Outside of games
