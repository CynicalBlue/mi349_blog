            Hello. I am Austin Whitis. I am a Games and Interactive Media Bachelors major at MSU. I like to make and play games. I mainly focus on game development and game design, though, as drawing and such isn't my thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of what I do revolves around this. I live in the woods, however, so I do go outside from time to time. Though, when I don't, I still have a handful of activities I do that aren't directly game related. Speaking of that. Outside of games I like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rock music</li>
            <li>Going outside in the woods</li>
            <li>Watching animated shows (pictured below)</li>
        </ul>
