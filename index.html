    <p>Today I focused on and finished all of my FOR101 
        work for the week.  For the most part.  There is 
        still the identifying trees project, but that 
        isn't due for a bit longer, and I want to stall 
        until the weather is colder, as it has been 
        relatively warm outside for a while now despite 
        it almost being October.  I tend to have better 
        mood and such in colder areas, and I'd need that 
        for how tedious an assignment identifying twenty 
        trees is going to be with how much information 
        is needed to be filled out.  It's still better 
        than working on some of my other assignments, 
        at least.  My usual weekly assignments can 
        range in difficulty considerably.  Some weeks 
        can essentially be freebies while others require 
        an entire day to make sure I finish them with 
        spare time.  I have a bad habit of procrastinating, 
        however, so that's more likely to be on me.  Still, 
        I make sure I have enough time for assignments.  
        I scout out what they are early in the week, then 
        I set time aside for them during the week in 
        accordance with their perceived difficulty.  
        Issues only arrive when I judge poorly, or if 
        something major happens that I didn't expect, 
        but 99% of the time, all goes well.  Anyway, 
        pictured below is my favorite tree, the White 
        Spruce.

    <p>This day is the one I have delegated for my Web 
        Design and Development assignment as well as 
        some coding work for my game.  For the latter, 
        methods for every notable event that can happen 
        in battle is now added, so I have to implement 
        those methods into code that activates those 
        events and such.  I'm also supposed to add two 
        classes, but that's lower priority with how 
        many we already have added, and classes are 
        pretty easy to add if I already have the 
        necessary methods existing.  75% of the time 
        taken up by new classes is when I have to add 
        something new to the code to make them work 
        properly.  This being statuses, resources, 
        or just straight up new events and such.  
        That last part is the least common now, as 
        my work compounds more and more to where 
        there is few events not already coded due to 
        added previous classes.  In terms of the 
        school assignment, this is it, and it is 
        rather tedious, but I've learned how to code 
        best from the most grueling of tasks.  That's 
        hyperbole due to the medium difficulty of this 
        assignment, mind you.  The assignments in this 
        class always seem harder than they actually are 
        once you start working on them.  The lengthy 
        instructions throws you off a bit when starting.  
        Below is a data table to illustrate how I 
        distribute time for assignments.
